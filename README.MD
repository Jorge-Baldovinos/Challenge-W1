s# Module One Challenge

## Description
I refactored this web page to meet accessibility standards. This webpage was created as an on-the-job ticket to allow boot camp students to implement the tools gained in their first week of the course. The webpage began as a cloned starter code containing all non-semantic tags to have a boot camp student make any necessary alterations while considering web accessibility standards.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
This webpage can be used as an example of Semantic HTML. The user can open the DevTools and view the source code to find the logical and semantic HTML structure. The user may also use screen reading software to navigate the page via the headings and listen to the alternate text in each image.
