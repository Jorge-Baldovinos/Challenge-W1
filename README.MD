# Module One Challenge

## Description
I refactored this web page to meet accessibility standards. This webpage was created as an on-the-job ticket to allow boot camp students to implement the tools gained in their first week of the course. The webpage began as a cloned starter code containing all non-semantic tags to have a boot camp student make any necessary alterations while considering web accessibility standards.
